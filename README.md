# Covid-19Tracker
It is an android application built using REST API and Retrofit. It shows the active, recovered, total cases and total deaths due to Covid-19. There's also a pie chart which shows these data in an attractive and an easy-to-read format. Any user can view these data of any country. The default country location will be user's current location, but they can see the data of any country by selecting that country's name from the drop-down list.
